Hello. My name is Adam. I am a maths student at the University of Warwick.

I used to be a custom ROM maintainer but now I don't have enough time for it.

I am interested in aerospace so you'll probably find stuff about rockets, drones and balloons on here.

And sometimes the occasional bit of maths.

And more balloons.

I also like cycling so there might be some stuff related to that.
We'll see.

For now it will mostly be balloons.
